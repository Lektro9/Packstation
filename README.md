# Packstation
In this Repository I am showing my solution to our coding exercise in class.

# Trouble executing unit tests? try this:

unittest fix (visual studio 2017)
- right click UnitTestPackstation
- Properties
- choose "Build"
- change "Platform target" to "any CPU" (or try out other settings)

- maybe you also have to change:
- "Test"
- "Test Settings"
- "Default Processor Architecture"
- change to x86 or x64
